BRAT Lab files for generating Channel State Information (CSI) datasets with QuaDRiGa channel model. Source files must be downloaded from [QuaDRiGa](https://quadriga-channel-model.de/#Download) to run.

## Background

Most papers only use COST2100 channel model for deep learning-based CSI estimation. To validate our new network, [MarkovNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09468), on additional CSI datasets, I am writing this repo for the QuaDRiGa channel model. 

Scenarios:
- [TODO] Outdoor LOS, 5.3GHz, 32Tx/1Rx, UE Mobility of 0.9m/s, 1024 subcarriers or 20kHZ bandwidth
- [DOING] Outdoor LOS, 300MHz, 32Tx/1Rx, UE Mobility of 0.9m/s, 1024 subcarriers or 20kHZ bandwidth
